    <h2>Early Life</h2>
    <h3>What Did Galileo Discover?</h3>
    <P>Born in Piza, Italy in 1564, Galileo Galilei would grow to become the planet's first ever astronomer, and become known as "The Godfather of Modern Science"
    Science was maturing into an evidence based on testing and turning it’s back on a previously philosophical approach to the pursuit of truth.</p>

    <h2>The Event</h2>
    <P>Some mistakenly attribute Galileo as the inventor of the telescope, but that’s not quite true  – that honour goes to Dutch spectacle maker Johann Lippershey (1570-1619). </P>
    <p>Galileo did however improve on the design, achieving greater magnification but, he also turned the invention – for the first time in history – towards the stars and planets of the night sky. This eventually (there were some hiccups) would lead to better and better telescopes and an increased understanding of our universe. Without Galileo there would be no moon landings, no Big Bang Theory or no GPS!</p>
  <p>By studying the movement of the objects in the night sky Galileo could prove correct the hypothesis of Copernicus, who in 1543 proposed that the Earth was orbiting the sun, and not – as was widely believed at the time – the other way around. This is known as Copernican heliocentrism. </P>
