# A Tribute to Galileo Galilei
project1-freecodecamp-tributepage
Thank you for checking out my project. This was first completed as part of Responsive Web Design course at FreeCodeCamp
 
Since completing this small project and beginning a FCC course in Javascript Datastructures & Algorithms, I came to the conclusion that, in order to get into the industry I would need some well styled, modern websites to hold any kind of attention that I may get. THerefore, I returned to this basic project with a thought to add some graphics and movement to take this up a few levels. 

# The Design Process

Firstly I used Adobe Illustrator to draw some of the icons I would be using. I really liked some of the icons I found as reference so to save time, I used some of those too. Reference list below and code will reflect this.

### I then imported the images into Adobe XD and started planning out the page layouts

### Once the layout is completed, I split each screen and begin 'prototyping' - animations and transitions
